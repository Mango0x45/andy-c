Building
========

Building Andy requires nothing more than a C compiler.  Ideally you
should also have pkg-config(1) installed on your system, but it is not
required.

    $ cc -o make make.c
    $ ./make


Tips For Developers
===================

For a more ‘make-like-feel’, the following may be useful:

    $ alias make `{git rev-parse --show-toplevel}/make

The following might also be very handy if you find that the generated
object files polute your file listing:

    $ alias ls (ls --hide='*.o')

It’s probably also good to always be building debug builds.  An alias
might be useful:

    $ alias make (make -d)
